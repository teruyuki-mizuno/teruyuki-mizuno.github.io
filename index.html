        <h1>Teruyuki Mizuno</h1>
        <p>I am a tenure-track assistant professor at the Graduate School 
            of Humanities and Sciences at Ochanomizu University, Tokyo. 
            I am a theoretical linguist working on natural language semantics and pragmatics.
        </p>
        <p>Prior to joining Ochanomizu University, 
            I completed my PhD in linguistics in 2023 at the University of Connecticut, 
            under the supervision of Stefan Kaufmann.
        </p>
        <p>At Ochanomizu, I organize a joint seminar on formal semantics with Bekki Lab.
